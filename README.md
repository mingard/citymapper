# Citymapper Router Challenge



## Requirements

This build requires [go 1.13](https://golang.org/dl/#go1.13.14) to be installed and configured according to the official [go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Compiling the build

I have included a Makefile to handle build, which will compile the binary automatically before running the application.

If you wish to build it manually, run `make build`

### Other Makefile options

`make clean` will remove any previously cached builds.

`make version` will output the version info.

`make fmt` will format the code to [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) standards.
